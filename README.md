# IP_Blocklist

Numerous scammers originating from Lagos, Nigeria have been reaching out to me via Social Media under the guise of local women seeking relationships. It has come to my attention that many of these individuals are engaged in love scams or have ulterior motives aimed at extorting money from unsuspecting victims. As a proactive measure, I'm in the process of compiling a comprehensive database of identified scammers' IP addresses, along with details about their devices, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and geographical locations. Any scammer attempting to contact me will automatically have their IP address extracted and added to this IP block list database. This initiative is aimed at safeguarding myself and potentially others from falling victim to these fraudulent activities.

In a world where finding genuine connections through dating can already be challenging, the presence of these scammers from Lagos, Nigeria further compounds the difficulties. Their deceptive tactics, often posing as local women interested in relationships, create an environment of mistrust and uncertainty. These scammers are not only seeking emotional manipulation but also have intentions to exploit individuals financially.

To counteract this unfortunate situation, I'm actively curating a robust database that documents the IP addresses of these scammers, as well as pertinent details about their devices, ISP providers, and geographical locations. This initiative is designed to serve as a protective measure, not only for myself but for others who might encounter these fraudulent activities. By pooling our resources and knowledge, we can collectively fortify our online dating experiences and help pave the way for genuine connections to flourish without the looming threat of exploitation.
